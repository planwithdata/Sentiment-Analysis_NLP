       "22                       People drive their cars at excessive speeds on Brookland Parkway. We need these bike lanes protected, and the space needs for cars needs to be reimagined to encourage safe speeds. City streets should not have speed limits higher than 25 MPH, but especially on those with bike lanes. Active transportation and high speeds are a dangerous/deadly combination. I cannot wait to have safe, protected space to ride here.   \n",

Henrico is unlikely to ever approve a vehicular connection from Ridgefield to Tuckahe Creek Parkway but bike/ped crossings in that area (Coach Rd), closer to GreenGate to the North, and at Patterson to the South would make this a true regional trail -- not just a locality specific out and back on both sides of the creek.   \n",

You would first be caught driving between Rockets Landing and the CSX train terminal. I am unaware of how this portion of the Route would be able to be expanded as each property is privately owned and would cost millions to expand if acquiring the CSX property is the only possible way. After you pass this section you are surrounded by multiple gas reserves and then drive up the side of Marion Hill.

I strongly advise that funds are re-attributed to other projects that better direct traffic away from the community connector road that is forest hill ave. and instead build a safer/more efficient intersection at both or either of Dundee Ave. and W Roanoke St. to better direct traffic to Midlothian Turnpike - a road in which is intended to be a main thoroughfare through this part of the city. The 47th street to Semmes Ave. section of the roadway is rarely ever a choke point and it rather stems from the inefficient timing and placement of the W Roanoke street intersection.

I find the traffic a bit much sometimes as well but one improvement would be to better coordinate the lights at Roanoke and Semmes so the traffic moves seamlessly. I know, the city finds that almost impossible to do. And while I'm at it, stop with the traffic circles.  I have some near me that are literally 5 feet across. Really?

Adding lanes will take away from both of these incredibly important aspects of the neighborhood. It will physically take away from the park and the historic properties to create something that the people of the area do not want nor need. It will create more flow to the area, requiring more upkeep for the park and make it a less pedestrian friendly place to go. 3) The cost involved could be far better used in a multitude of ways including the re-pavement of roads in the area or better upkeep of sidewalks and bike lanes.</td>\n",

Since moving here in June of 2020, we have witnessed 5 car accidents and a pedestrian being struck by a vehicle right out front of our home - absolutely terrifying. The widening of FHA will not slow cars down nor make it safer for bikers and walkers, but will only encourage more traffic and dangerous driving maneuvers. We own a dog and I am already hesitant and scared to walk on FHA with the current large median because of the reckless driving.

This is an expensive, thoughtless solution in search of a problem. Forest Hill Park is our life, and if this project proceeds, everyone in Forest Hill Terrace will be cut off from it. I am absolutely astounded that anyone thinks this is needed.</td>\n",

There are police cars sometimes. But the police catches perhaps 1 out 50 speeding cars. The norm there is that cars are constantly driving way too fast on 4 lanes. The major feeding arteries to the city should not go through a residential district which is historic and recreational. The parks close to Forest Hill Ave attract families with children and bikers who will be exposed to more traffic and more danger. There are churches and a school who are mostly reached by foot. There are children and and a lot of elderly residents. Not a race track</td>\n",

The amount of speeding cars will be doubled at least. Why is Route 60, Midlothian Turnpike, not widened and brought back to its original purpose? It is a major artery and goes from 6 lanes to 2 lanes. That road could just continue to bring traffic to Cowardin Ave into the city and it goes partly through old commercial buildings. It might bring new live into that area and give the city an incentive to revive this stretch of Midlothian Avenue.</td>\n",

When you look at Semmes Ave between the Patrick Henry School and Cowardin Ave you see that a four lane road only increases the number of speeding cars, more danger to residents young and old crossing the road, more noise, more pollution and the Police unable to control the speeding. I see it all the time that cars are constantly driving at least 10 miles over the speed limit. We don't need this in a historic, residential and recreational neighborhood. Stop lights are only minimally able to reduce these hazards and maximally increase the noise and the pollution. Instead, the City should turn Midlothian Turnpike, Route 60,Â  from Westover Hills Blvd to Cowarding into the same size as it is west of that stretch and relieve Forest Hill Ave of unnecessary traffic. The city could put $ 12.000.000 into restoring the run down commercial area on Midlothian Turnpike, attract new businesses and make it attractive for the traffic to use the Turnpike.

This would reduce the value of homes in the area and change its character.  It's already difficult to cross Forest Hill Ave, either walking or driving, and this would complicate it. There are many lovely homes on that part of Forest Hill. With smaller yards and a busier street, the values go down and the sense of neighborhood is lost.

There is insufficient enforcement, if any, of speed limits in the area as it is and this proposal will only exacerbate the problems already present with diver's behaviors. Pedestrians, even with the flashing light crossings already present, take enough risk trying to traverse the width of Forest Hill now.

We need these bike lanes protected, and the space needs for cars needs to be reimagined to encourage safe speeds. City streets should not have speed limits higher than 25 MPH, but especially on those with bike lanes. Active transportation and high speeds are a dangerous/deadly combination. I cannot wait to have safe, protected space to ride here.   \n",

Henrico is unlikely to ever approve a vehicular connection from Ridgefield to Tuckahe Creek Parkway but bike/ped crossings in that area (Coach Rd), closer to GreenGate to the North, and at Patterson to the South would make this a true regional trail -- not just a locality specific out and back on both sides of the creek.   \n",

Unfortunately, you're forced to compete for a narrow slip of sidewalk with each other and the folks who are fishing from the bridge. A redesign should provide more space for non-motorized travel, especially since cars/trucks have the option of using the I-95 bridge or high-speed Manchester Bridge (which has lots of excess capacity even after the recent slight road diet).   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

NO roads should be widened unless it's to reallocate right of way to bus lanes, bike lanes, and multi-use paths. Adding lanes does not add capacity!   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

If anything, the current bike lanes need to be lifted above curb level as the actual travel speeds in this section regularly exceed the 55 MPH limit. With further highest density development along this corridor, pedestrian infrastructure needs to be complete as well - sidewalks are few and far between in this stretch. A sidewalk connected to nothing else along a high speed road serves little purpose.   \n",

People sometimes walk along the shoulders, and cars going faster increases the risk of someone being killed.   \n",

We shouldn't route traffic down a small residential street unless absolutely necessary-- and it's not.   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

We already have an amazing Capital Trail. What we don't want is 4 lanes that run straight into a bottleneck in the city. When are we going to get away from designing our lives around cars. This historic route needs to be preserved. It is an asset to the community. This is the gateway to 50 miles of history to Williamsburg. Please change your thinking from one that conveniences developers to one that enhances our way of life.   \n",

Aside from the farmland that would be acquired from families to expand the road ridding this area of its natural beauty. There are multiple man-made structures on both sides of the road. How will people residing in these residences be impacted by the widening of the road? Due to safety regulations, they will have to sell their house and property to the county for a devalued price and move somewhere else. Not only lowering property values but driving longtime residents away from their community. I understand that people are looking to expand the number of people living on this side of Henrico but there needs to be a better conversation about it with more community input.   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5 and other areas of the county where it's unnecessary? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

As a person who frequently uses the Capital Trail along this stretch (the existing wide bike and pedestrian facility) widening does not make any sense given what I have perceived is the lower volume of traffic along this route. The property owners have also made a lot of effort to protect the farm land and existing green space, Widening will only start a process of over development in the area.   \n",

Again. This entrance into the city is constrained by the river on one side and Churchill on the other.  There is no way to absorb 4 lanes of traffic onto small city streets with out bottlenecks or destroying the character of the city.  Also we already have a wonderful bike and pedestrian facility called the Capital Trail which is much used and beloved. Widen that if you need to. There's plenty of room off road for that.   \n",

No need to widen the road. The bike trail is such a success.  It is stated that there will be added capacity bike/ped facilities.  Was that added just to gain support? We're not stupid  Just an FYI, private businesses who pay taxes are currently developing/expanding ways to meet those needs.  Why ruin it by adding more cars to the area. I'm very disappointed that this is being considered.   \n",
       "220                             I have concerns when it comes to the widening of New Market Road from the Richmond City limits to New Osborne Turnpike. My main concern here is how widening the road would work. Along this stretch of Route 5 there is little to no extra room on the side of the road. If you were to leave the City of Richmond, heading eastward towards Williamsburg. You would first be caught driving between Rockets Landing and the CSX train terminal. I am unaware of how this portion of the Route would be able to be expanded as each property is privately owned and would cost millions to expand if acquiring the CSX property is the only possible way. After you pass this section you are surrounded by multiple gas reserves and then drive up the side of Marion Hill. Again my same concerns are how would this portion be widening when there are no feasible ways of doing so. Unless removing a portion of the bike trail to bringing in dirt to flatten that portion of the Hill is the only option.   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

Currently cars frequently exceed the 30 MPH speed limit and this street is very difficult to cross as a pedestrian.

       "249     This project is an poor use of funding, especially given the only marginal benefits this would return long term for the multi-year impact to the entirety of the forest hill neighborhood and visitors of forest hill park. This is especially my viewpoint as the duration of the project and impacts from the Powhite overpass to the Old Westham/Hathaway Rd. intersection. I strongly advise that funds are re-attributed to other projects that better direct traffic away from the community connector road that is forest hill ave. and instead build a safer/more efficient intersection at both or either of Dundee Ave. and W Roanoke St. to better direct traffic to Midlothian Turnpike - a road in which is intended to be a main thoroughfare through this part of the city. The 47th street to Semmes Ave. section of the roadway is rarely ever a choke point and it rather stems from the inefficient timing and placement of the W Roanoke street intersection. I highly doubt traffic loads justify the use of funds.   \n",

The speeding cars on  this section of Forest Hill are a huge problem here!

You will be destroying our property values and the look of an older neighborhood that's trying it's best to get on its feet. Do you know how hard people work on improving their community around here? Could the city make it any more clear they don't care about the southside?  We may not be The Fan, but just because we have the lower property values, doesn't mean we don't count! FOUR LANES IN A HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD will cause a speed way, risking lives of residents and kids and pets, destroying the historic nature of the neighborhood and devastating home values.   \n",

It does get terribly congested, especially in the mornings, but I think that much of this can be attributed to poor traffic management at the school.  I can't count the number of times that the light at Semmes turns green and I am immediately stopped by the crossing guard.  If the crossing guard gave priority to car traffic on Semmes and Forest Hill during green lights, then this project can probably be pushed off for a while.  This is anecdotal, I know, but I find traffic runs very smoothly on months when school is out of session.   \n",

       "270           Having worked in economic development for the past 10 years and worked on several transportation plans, I would say that this is a bad idea.  Widening lanes are transportation engineers answer for everything and many times it fails to have the desired outcome. What often happens is a phenomena known as 'induced demand' where the widening actually induces more people to travel the roads and eventually the larger roads end up just as busy and backed up as the previously unwidened roads.  Especially in an area that is walkable, and has a sense of place and community, widening this road would diminish the sense of community and walkability and turn the area into more of a thoroughfare.  This type of road widening plan comes from antiquated urban planning principles and is not in line with the latest trends in community placemaking.  There are other traffic calming measures that could be put in place, and that $12M could go along way to enhancing the community instead of depleting it.   \n",

I cannot think of a worse way to spend the city's money. Especially when this project inevitably goes over budget. This stretch of road is incredibly dangerous as is, as I have seen first hand multiple pedestrians struck by vehicles in cross walks. If the goal is to improve flow of traffic, I think any commuter who uses this road would take the current state over having to deal with years of backups from construction - again, all for 0.9 miles of road. There are many better ways this money can be spent - traffic lights, speed enforcement (absolutely terrible for a highly residential area with a park), speed bumps, etc. Making this 4 lanes will just cause chaos, more injuries, and ruin the beautiful neighborhood we have.   \n",

       "275                                This section of Forest Hill Avenue runs through the Forest Hill neighborhood, designated as a national historic district.  This proposal would have a negative impact on this historic and beautiful neighborhood.  The neighborhood was one of Richmond's early \"Street Car suburbs.\" It seems a sad irony to destroy this neighborhood to advantage those in today's automobile suburbs at a time when the age of the automobile is ending. There are two churches on this stretch.  One of them houses a school and the other an early- childhood learning facility.  There is a high volume of pedestrian traffic, and crossing Forest Hill Avenue is already very difficult for residents of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Although the speed limit was recently reduced to 30 miles an hour, and two crossing lights have been installed (one at 41st and one at 43rd) crossing remains a hazard, as drivers ignore the lights and travel well above the speed limit. I strongly oppose this project.   \n",

People already drive way too fast down forest hill, and pedestrian crossing is already difficult with two lanes.

This would drive a stake between neighbors on each side and create a dangerous border for each. I drive this road daily and once a week I find someone that is easily traveling 60+ mph and weaving into opposing traffic lanes.  This proposal may help some in the short term with congestion but it would cause even more problems with increased traffic, speeding and injuries in the future.  Why does anyone feel like this is a good idea? We should be putting speed tables on Forest Hill and encouraging commuters to use the highway or Midlothian Turnpike instead.

I find the traffic a bit much sometimes as well but one improvement would be to better coordinate the lights at Roanoke and Semmes so the traffic moves seamlessly. I know, the city finds that almost impossible to do. And while I'm at it, stop with the traffic circles.  I have some near me that are literally 5 feet across. Really?

       "288      This project is a waste of money. None of what is proposed is necessary to that stretch of road. Bike lanes already exist. There are no traffic bottlenecks that coordinating traffic lights wouldn't fix. Even so, traffic is slow ONLY for a few minutes during rush hour, made so by people who should be using Powhite Parkway, and who drive on FH as if it were Powhite. This is a historic district with beautiful trees that would be destroyed and beautiful homes whose property value would plummet.  You already have destroyed everything in your path during the Stratford Hills project (where, btw, electrical wires were to be buried but instead you added MORE poles straight down the middle of the road - HIDEOUS).  This is not a project supported by the neighborhood. The people who live here day in/ day out, matter most. Please respect that. With a city that either is so underfunded or so badly mismanages our tax dollars, put this money to much better use, like schools, ofr maintaining the roads   \n",

I live at the other end of Forest Hill Ave. and I have lived through 12 years of construction, eminent domain and life disruption.  For what??  For more asphalt, more cars, more pollution, more noise and little gain.  $ 12 million dollars could do so much good in this community...parks, schools, homeless.... oh... I see... you have to do something to grab Federal $$ and so you use \"widening a road\" as a good excuse.   Do NOT let this happen!   \n",

You are looking at ruining the beauty of the neighborhood.  Crossroads is a local hangout!  People walk there, ride bikes there, and sit out on the patio.  Access would be a problem, too. Begin at PHSSA, the classes sometimes use the bridge to walk to the park.  The bridge would have to be widened for the bike lanes.  What about traffic during this construction.  Land would be taken from the park?  It is a historic place.  The apartments could loose their off the street parking.  The landscaping in front of the house on Forest Hill would be ruined.  The 5-6 minutes extra it takes to travel that section of Forest Hill during morning and afternoon rush hour is not worth the change. I AM TOTALLY AGAINST IT!   \n",

Since the city will not add a stop light between 34th and and 26th and Semmes, the only other thing that marginally helps traffic volume and speed on Semmes is the two lane section of Forest Hill and the traffic light at Roanoke.  Making Forest Hill four lanes between 47th and Semmes with nothing more will turn Semmes into a no speed limit autobahn.  Further, it will destroy the appearance of Forest Hill Park and be a nightmare for people who reside on Forest Hill.   \n",

Above all, this is a neighborhood in the truest sense of the word. It is a rewcognized, historical district. Most of these homes have been here since the '40s, a good number for 100 years or longer. Residents routinely cross FH Ave., some pushing strollers, some with pets. This stretch of FHA is home to two churches, a elementary school and a rehabilitation center. Entering and exiting FH Park would become a problem. No one living within the city of Richmond would see an improvement in their quality of life or travel from this project. For whose benefit would a historic neighborhood be sacrificed? We built an entire expressway to move folks who live west of Richmond into downtown. Leave Forest Hill Avenue a neighborhood street and the historic neighborhood intact.   \n",

As a 10 year resident of a house sitting on 4300 block of Forest Hill Ave please do not widen the road. We need to put more speed maintenance measures in place because it's used as a raceway right now. Getting across FHA is dangerous to pedestrians and there have been people hit in pedestrian crosswalks because commuters don't see this as a neighborhoodâ€”they see it as a cut through. The noise and road pollution is already a constant battle that will only be further exacerbated if there were 2 more lanes. No please no. I don't want to lose any of my property to this effort and I don't want my neighbors sitting on FHA to lose property either.   \n",

What about the historic homes on Forest Hill in this stretch? Keep the bike lanes and make them safer by all means, but making this a highway is a terrible idea. There are plenty of ways to get downtown  if people are too impatient they should take one of the existing highways and not destroy a historic area. It is hard enough now to safely cross to get to the park with my children and almost impossible on Semmes. I guess we would slide into the almost impossible group if I am still here with my grandchildren in 2045.   \n",

The current speed on forest hill ave already feels too fast and the â€œprotectedâ€ crosswalks are ignored 9/10 . This is an area that is rich with walkers, bikers, families, and dog walkers.  In the true spirit of the Richmond lifestyle let's make this area safer for outdoor activity and the neighbors living in the area. A widened road will attract more commuters using the road as a way through the city and make the area more congested.   \n",

I STRONGLY OPPOSE widening this section of Forest Hill Avenue. (1) Many houses, like mine, on this section of Forest Hill are already close to the street, and taking much of our front yard would leave our house uncomfortably close to the street, which will have even more traffic. The impact on home owners of reducing our already small front yards would be even more negative than the impacts on those homeowners further west on the section of Forest Hill where street widening is still ongoing. (2) While traffic increases at rush hour, this is not a real problem. Widening Forest Hill might be expected to reduce commute time by perhaps 5 minutes, not a substantial benefit to the city and resulting in significant harm to the home owners (and voters) who would be negatively affected.   \n",

(4) Reducing the space between our front door and the street would reduce the value of our home. (5) This is an historically significant neighborhood (our home was built in 1893), and an increasingly busy four-lane street running through it would negatively impact its character. (6) The removal of mature trees would be another significant cost of this proposed widening of Forest Hill Ave. In our block alone, a giant pine, a beautiful mature Tulip Poplar, and mature spruce would all likely be taken down.   \n",

It is fine at other times. The speeding problems are due to lack of enforcement, and also folks using all of Forest Hill Ave as a cut thru from other areas. Adding 2 more lanes turns this neighborhood into a race way. A single protected bikelane could be put on One Side of the road without having to widen the existing road and cut into folk's historic properties. I'm not anti-bike but I see I don't see the bike lanes in Semmes used very often.We have been enduring the interminable Forest Hill Road expansion west of Powhite for nearly 10 years. Basic infrastructure needs like Storm Drainage, Pothole repair and Road Repaving should take priority for projects in this neighborhood. Our roads are in terrible shape and have been neglected for years.   \n",

This section of Forest Hill has a number of historic properties and is part of an urban neighborhood center. There is already a high volume of speeding traffic on the roadway as well as existing bike lanes, making it difficult to leave the neighborhood as well as cross streets in and out of the park area. The area would be better served by a road diet - using traffic calming such as wider curb cuts, traffic circles and lights to slow traffic coming off the FH exit of 195. The majority of traffic is seeking to elude tolls on 195 going downtown from outer suburbs - why should we privilege them while hurting residents and reducing property values in an older residential neighborhood?   \n",

I have lived on the corner of FH and 42nd St. for 42 years.  We deal with speeding traffic and drivers that ignore pedestrian crossings.  Widening FH will only make this worse. I strongly oppose this proposal.   \n",
       "335       This project seems unnecessary, and I believe that $12M is better spent elsewhere. The proposed widening aligns almost exactly with the east/west boundaries of the designated historical district. This project would be in derogation of the filing, which notes, \"the roads conform to the natural landscape features, creating a scenic environ.\" Further, it states, \"throughout the neighborhood, large trees, landscape strips, and mature foundation plantings around most of the houses contribute to a park-like and well-established feeling.\" Widening of Forest Hill Ave would jeopardize both aspects of the historical designation, as many front yards and trees would be destroyed. The scenic views on Forest Hill would convert to a wide swath of asphalt, with an undesirable loss of character and beauty. Speeding is already a problem on this stretch of Forest Hill; widening to 4 lanes will exacerbate the situation.  Additionally, there are already bike lanes in this stretch.  Please do not do this!   \n",

Besides changing the character of this beautiful neighborhood significantly, widening the roadway here to include more lanes will turn what is already becoming a dangerous speedway into a super speedway. We can't even cross the street here now without risking our lives, and the speeding at night is even worse. This money is far better spent in finding an alternative route for commuters and slowing drivers down on the existing road with the addition of traffic lights, speed bumps, whatever it takes.

I have commuted on Forest Hill Ave. my entire life and it gets a normal amount of congestion during rush hour, but nothing that would warrant this project. As a life-long Richmond resident, I have always found this district to be aesthetically pleasing and psychologically uplifting to drive through. On the other hand, driving down roads like Broad St. and Midlothian Tnpk., cause a great deal of psychological stress. People who choose to live in Southside, are there because they do not want to live in a high traffic, commercialized environment. This is why they pay the elevated taxes that they do, to the city. And now, the city decides they can simply come in and ruin the property value, which is likely these families' primary investment. We will not stand for it.   \n",

Speeding is a huge issue for this stretch of forest hill avenue even with crosswalks. There are regularly accidents along this road due to speeding and this will worsen with 4 lanes of traffic. It will also deter walkers and runners making it more difficult to cross 4 lanes of traffic.   \n",

Has someone actually measured the current frontage?  If sidewalks are to remain, they would have to be placed through my front porch. There are two times during a business day when traffic is â€œheavyâ€ - morning and evening commutes.   The real problem is badly timed stop lights at Roanoke and Seemes and school crossing issues - adding two additional lanes will not solve the true problem. Besides eight hours of light \"congestion\", the other 160 hours of the week traffic moves along very nicely, in fact, to nicely - like 45-50 miles per hour in a 35 mph zone.  How about some speed bumps? Does the cost include property value losses?  This plan has obviously not been thought out. Our neighborhood is prepared to engage in legal actions and recourse including compensation for property value losses. This plan is insane, stupid, misguided, and horrible.   \n",

It will only increase the amount of traffic from those who use this area as a cut through from downtown to the county in order to avoid tolls.  There are already issues for pedestrians attempting to cross the street with only 2 lanes and there are already bike lanes. Also the homes and apartments along this stretch are set very close to the street. This area is not meant to be a 4 lane highway to support commuters! This money would be better spent to repair the existing roads and sidewalks in the neighborhood which are in horrible condition. This plan makes absolutely no sense.   \n",

It is NOT the responsibility of the City of Richmond, nor its residents, to provide smooth commuting times to suburban residents! Current trends predict more and more people moving into the City and away from the suburbs -- so widening the road would be short sighted. This movement into the city coupled with predictions that many workers will continue to work from home offices for decades after the pandemic make the proposed changes unnecessary! Enlarging this road would be detrimental to one of the City's most livable and historic neighborhoods -- which has the best forest canopy of all the City's neighborhoods. The loss of mature trees and increase of road surface would increase area temperatures and result in loss of native birds and additional wildlife. Finally, the projected cost of $12,000,000 would be better spent on improving REGIONAL mass transit options.   \n",

       "367       Project HW-25 is a badly conceived idea. Widening Forest Hill Ave from 47 St to Semmes completely disregards the character of the neighborhood approaching Forest Hill Park from the west.  This is a historic area and the project will markedly damage its historic value, and the value and metropolitan ambience of the homes and streetscape.  There are already 2 bike lanes the length of this project, with heavy pedestrian traffic - babies in carriages and dogwalkers and runners - nearly always present. Adding/widening lanes presents a threat to the citizens who enjoy the area by siphoning even more traffic from larger capacity roadways. Even now, speeding is a chronic problem which will only get worse by adding to the road capacity of Forest Hill Ave.  This is a project that will severely diminish the quality of life along the corridor while providing no genuine benefit to the City aside from making commuters' drives marginally easier - and the commuters have numerous other route options.   \n",
       "368  First, widening the road is a â€œsolutionâ€ that would be worse than the problem. During the morning and evening commute, things can get backed up. This is a temporary annoyance that lasts for an hour or so, on weekdays. During much of the rest of the day/night, this BIGGEST PROBLEM is excessive speed. We see cars speeding at really really dangerous speeds, (there is a group that drag races motorcycles at 4am), and cars that are routinely unable (or unwilling) to stop at pedestrian crosswalks. I've seen speeding cars ride up on the sidewalk to avoid rear-ending someone. I've had a speeding car hop the sidewalk and nearly take out my infant son in a stroller, because they were going way way way too fast wit make a turn. If you ask anyone in the neighborhood, the biggest problem is speed, NOT congestion. The only thing keeping this street from being a highway IS the fact that a driver obeying the speed limit can slow the careless drivers behind them. If we have multiple lanes, this just bri   \n",

       "374       The transportation benefits associated with this project are marginal at best and its impacts on the quality of life in the affected communities are clearly detrimental, However, perhaps the most questionable aspect of the proposal is the estimated $12 million price tag. Widening the r-o-w to accommodate four full lanes plus bike lanes and sidewalks would necessitate significant takings, probably along both sides of the existing roadway. There are approximately 50 single-family homes, plus apartments and institutional parcels that would be affected along the proposed route. In addition, the existing Reedy Creek bridge can only accommodate 3 travel lanes at best. Replacing that facility would cost more than the projected cost for the entire project. Utility relocation would be another challenging and expensive aspect of construction. The current Powhite to Hathaway project on FHA (now ten years past design approval) should serve as a cautionary tale on how not to do road improvements.   \n",

Believe me, I know: While I live on a fairly quiet street, it's used as a through street to Westover Hills Blvd. and people speed on it all the time. In 3 years, I've seen five accidents, including four cars totaled (including my own), so speeding has real-life impact (no pun intended). It's a miracle no people or pets have been hurt. Not to mention what this Forest Hill project would do to the homeowners' yards who live along that stretch. Use the $$ for mass transit and/or more traffic calming / traffic cops. (I'm not opposed to roundabouts, btw.) Thank you. Judy Arginteanu   \n",

Another alternative is to evaluate the cost effectiveness to construct an automotive tunnel employing the Boring Company's technology. Connect2045 needs to be forward thinking and not stuck in dated approaches to transportation needs. Thank you, Alex Marten   \n",

       "378                I moved to Forest Hill 12 years ago because it had charm - an historic area that developed as a respite from the bustle of city. There are mature trees, beautiful homes, and the sounds of train whistles. It's a place to slow down and to appreciate the beauty around us. I strongly oppose the widening of Forest Hill Avenue between 47th Street and Semmes Avenue. It will harm the residents as well as ruin what is left of the charm here. It will cause property values to plummet. What problem is sought to be remedied?  There is, at most, heavier traffic during normal rush hours that might result in a minutes longer commute than during other times of the day. Widening the road will encourage more people to cut through the neighborhood. Soon there will be the same slowdowns during rush hour but with more cars.  Aren't there actual problems that need focus? The money could be better used to serve the residents here through other projects. Don't turn Forest Hill Avenue into a thruway.   \n",

I have lived right on Forest Hill close to the park for over 23 years and have loved seeing the progress of our Park, restaurants and Historic Homes.  West Over Elementary and Patrick Henry are both a major part of the uplift in the neighborhood. DaVinci's will be disrupted by losing their parking for their business.  The safety of children, animals and pedestrians would be at stake.  The lovely yards and historic trees  would be gone and what for ... quicker commutes and louder noise . The money could be spent for much more needed use -  The is a very lovely place to live in the city and if this happens home values will deeply decline and the city will continue to lose residents.  Stop the expansion PLEASE . WE love our neighborhood, safety and our homes.   \n",

I encourage the development of protected bike lanes and increased pedestrian safety for walking along this stretch of the road, and crossing the street at any point. Widening the road would threaten the mass, the access, and use of Forest Hill Park, as well as increase car traffic in an already traffic-congested region.

I have lived one block off Forest Hill at W43rd St. since 1986.  It will increase traffic and pollution on Forest Hill Ave.; destroy the front yards of many homes on both sides of the street and is an out of date solution to heavy commuter  traffic.  We should be looking at mass transit improvements.  Lower the tolls on the expressway and funnel Chesterfield traffic to downtown on the DOWNTOWN EXPRESSWAY instead of polluting this beautiful neighborhood .  As it is I have to drive 1 block to attend my church because trying to walk across endangers my life. Vehicles do not stop at the crosswalks.   \n",

If the project is anything like the widening of Forest Hill, west of the Powhite, it's destined to be an ugly mess for a couple of years. We think about leaving the city often, but we love our Forest Hill Terrace neighborhood, use of the park, and small town feel of the southside. This might just cause us to move. And if we don't move, I will NEVER vote for anyone who supports this project, EVER AGAIN.   \n",

Would like to know who came up with this idea and why.  I have lived happily right off of Forest Hill near the park for over 45 years, our first house when we were young and now we are seniors.  We live right off the area mentioned for widening.  It is one of the wonderful city neighbors and it is divided by Forest Hill and Semmes.  Rather than widening Forest Hill, I would prefer changing Semmes in a way similar to what has recently been done in Malvern, going from 4 traffic lanes to 2 with bike lanes and turn lanes.  We don't want our neighborhood used as a thoroughfare for those trying to get downtown.  They need to be using the toll roads.  Someone needs to look into reducing or eliminating the tolls.  We already have people speeding through our neighborhood and we don't want to support them going even faster. Terrible idea.   \n",

Drivers already routinely ignore pedestrian crosswalk lights - I cannot imagine how difficult it would be to cross four lanes safely.  The city should find ways to divert commuter traffic to already established thruways and devote any expansions to bike lanes ONLY.  Certainly not a terribly effective use of $12 million!   \n",
       "393                           I oppose this project adding cars, pollution and impermeable pavement: 1) Our neighborhood has asked for speed bumps, circles and protected bike lanes. And we've asked for *less cars*. To 'bucket' two opposing solutions together almost as a one-or-known, is unfair and may come across manipulative. What's up, RVA? 2) While you think *the space* exists, it doesn't. If you respect your people rebuilding RVA, this road is not a 4-laner. I'd argue how might it be *a one way*. This unique, quaint section should be realized now for its value. Like Church Hill, it's historic. 3) I believe it's worth considering Westover Ave, Hull St, Midlo Ave and other Semmes connection points with existing infrastructure to better use millions of $. What gives? 4) Community design. Forest Hill Terrace and residents north of Midlothian are a part of the Forest Hill neighborhood, too. We rely on equitable access to walk and bike to urban parks, farmers market, churches and schools safely.   \n",

I have lived on W 45th Street for 16 years and in the neighborhood for a total of 20 years. I have never actually experienced traffic, and I'm not too sure why we should spend $12 million dollars on this project. What about the beauty of the neighborhood streets? Trees that were planted with tax dollars--so, they're just supposed to be uprooted and removed for some perceived idea of a better flow of traffic? Take away a part of people's yards to make room for traffic? Certainly, there could be a better use of taxpayer dollars to other projects that could make a beneficial change. Education, for one.   \n",

Forest Hill Avenue does NOT need to be widened. Traffic counts don't warrant it. We need to slow traffic, not add more cars going faster. It seems like every time a road project is completed in this area, it is a waste of money and effort. The \"traffic calming circles\" are a joke. People still speed down W. 47th; the circle closest to my house has been damaged by speeders at least twice. How about you spend that $12 million where it's needed, rather than wasting it on marring a beautiful stretch of road through a designated HISTORIC area?   \n",

The traffic congestion happens at the intersection w North Roanoke and ONLY for the 1/8 mile where there's only one lane over the creek not two lanes as the rest of the highway.

Adding more lanes only adds more cars, traffic, congestion and accidents. A 4 lane Forest Hill Avenue will make it nearly impossible for pedestrians and bikers to cross (read: families and their children).  This is a poorly developed plan with little to no community outreach; hence the overwhelmingly opposition.   \n",

It would cause more traffic congestion, not alleviate it because it would encourage more people to use it as a commuter route. The city and VDOT proposed changes to Forest Hill Ave would turn the road into a highway with cars traveling at higher speeds making it less safe.

Property values have continued to rise in this neighborhood because people want to live here for the charm, the quiet, the convenient location, and proximity to Forest Hill Park and the James River. Drivers don't honor the 30mph speed limit or the pedestrian crossing lights as it is now. What will it be like at 4 lanes?

Like many have said before this comment, this will encourage increased speeds and harm the slower pace and charm of the neighborhood. I don't think anyone enjoys a busier road especially one that does not have an obvious need to be widened. Ultimately, this would have pedestrians and cyclists interacting with faster and certainly more dangerous traffic. Semmes is already bad enough and this seems like it would be similar to what Semmes is now. I'm a a Southside resident and home owner.   \n",

If anything, it needs to be narrowed to slow traffic down, perhaps with some of those curb bump outs like those installed further down on Bainbridge.  Encourage and protect pedestrian traffic instead - walking to the schools, the churches, the restaurants and businesses, and THE HUGELY POPULAR PARK within this stretch.  The lights installed at 41st and 43rd get ignored by most drivers, as most are speeding anyway.  Also, please consider doing away with the tolls on the Downtown Expressway.  It was built for this very purpose, and more commuters would use it if they didn't have to pay tolls and slow down to do so.  Certainly $12,000,000 could be better spent elsewhere, like maintaining the roads we already have.   \n",

Drivers regularly speed on this road, adding additional lanes will only increase the speed which vehicles travel and exponentially increase danger for pedestrians bikers. There are already bike lanes in place, that justification for the spend is fake on it's face. As a regular user of the Forest Hill bike lanes I'd like to keep the existing bike lanes with slower drivers rather than have new ones with drives going 50+mph beside me. Fast driving kills bikers, I don't care about improved bike lanes. Please do not waste money on this, please save lives and slow traffic down. Children cross this road to use the park and crossing 4 lanes is exceedingly dangerous because a car in one lane stopping does not mean the adjacent lane will stop. Please do not do this, you're going to kill people.   \n",

I'm always relieved when merging from the two lanes either from Semmes or further up Forest Hill, where cars whip in and out of lanes, trying to get one spot ahead while running cyclists and pedestrians off bike lanes and crosswalks, to the one lane at 30mph from Semmes to W 47th Street. With the current bike lanes and lighted crosswalks, drivers are mostly respectful of speed and are able to keep a close eye on cyclists and pedestrians, widening this stretch would completely destroy any amount of safety. As others have mentioned, removing the toll restriction on the Downtown Expressway would migrate a lot of this traffic away from Forest Hill, minimizing the environmental impact of cars on our community. It would simply be idiotic to proceed with this project.   \n",

       "417                      This is a very bad and unnecessary idea/project. The section of Forest Hill Avenue from Westover Hills Blvd to Semmes Ave is a lovely, historically important part of Richmond. There is no neighborhood in Richmond that is lovelier, more scenic, or more precious to its residents. Would such a project be accepted in Bellevue? In the West End? I think not...Southside continues to be treated like unwanted stepsister in this city.  Arguments that this is about safety are specious. If the City cared about safety in this area, there would be more traffic lights at street crossings; there would be speed reduction efforts; there would be more serious police presence. Widening Forest Hill Avenue will just be a lure for more traffic, at higher speeds, and be extremely unsafe for pedestrians and bicyclists (why create bike lanes on some streets and then make others a death trap?). Efforts should be made to REDUCE commuter traffic on this largely residential avenue. Stop. Just STOP.   \n",

       "419                              I do not support this project for a few important reasons. 1) It is unnecessary. There is very slight traffic at this area that never increases the drive by more than 1 minute. Construction will definitely impede traffic for the long course that it will take. Additionally, adding lanes will cause more flow through this street and will eventually cause actual trafﬁc problems that currently do not exist. 2) This is a historic neighborhood and park. Adding lanes will take away from both of these incredibly important aspects of the neighborhood. It will physically take away from the park and the historic properties to create something that the people of the area do not want nor need. It will create more flow to the area, requiring more upkeep for the park and make it a less pedestrian friendly place to go. 3) The cost involved could be far better used in a multitude of ways including the re-pavement of roads in the area or better upkeep of sidewalks and bike lanes.   \n",

While bike lanes would be nice, widening to four lanes here is an unnecessary and even harmful use of resources.  There are so many reasons not to widen such as significantly smaller front yards, loss of decades old trees, reduced home values and damaged character in an historically significant area and dangerous street crossing situations to name a few. The only potential upside I can possibly think of would be a very slight increase in commute time, if at all.  The traffic on this stretch moves pretty well and the only problematic situation is trying to make a left hand turn during rush hour.  That situation would only be made worse with four lanes. There are much more options for commuter thoroughfares. Please use this money elsewhere for a project that is truly needed and desired.   \n",

       "429                              I am very opposed to the proposed expenditure of $12,000,000 to widen Forest Hill Avenue. The costs to those who live on and near that section of Forest Hill Avenue are immeasurable. Safety is already a grave concern there, evidenced by the number of serious accidents occurring, often causing pedestrian and motor vehicle occupant injury. The inevitable reduction in the value and appearances of many homes impacts the city as a whole, as well as that neighborhood. Instead of using those funds on an expansion that will cause even more accidents, and have a deleterious impact on property values, spend it on removing tolls from some of the local city roads. People speed along Forest Hill Avenue, as well as Semmes Avenue during their daily comments, unaware of the impacts on local residents. If they could use the Downtown Expressway without charge, or if the Boulevard Bridge were free, some travel would be redirected, thus lessening the negative and damaging impacts.   \n",

The neighborhood is a city treasure, and running more traffic at a higher volume right through the heart of it would be disastrous!  Pedestrians have already been seriously injured on the stretch. There are close by corridors with plenty of capacity to channel traffic safely through the area. Corridors which were designed for that purpose. Midlothian Turnpike, the Downtown expressway. We do not need another major artery dissecting a historical neighborhood and jewel city park so folks can shave 2 minutes off their  commute to the counties.   \n",

There is already dangerous traffic behavior along this corridor that additional lanes would exacerbate due to increased volume and the psychological impacts on drivers who presume two lanes = highway speeds. Any widening of the road should be exclusively dedicated to protecting/widening the bicycle infrastructure. Additional signage (no passing in bike lane, speed limit, and yield to pedestrians) and blinking crosswalks would also be beneficial. Please allocate these funds to improving the current roadway and foot/bicycle traffic infrastructure.   \n",

Just take out the bike lanes and add a middle turn lane and you can save your money.  It is a huge waste of money when we can't even afford to fix and repave our residential roads.  We haven't had a repave in our area for MANY years 15++.  except for cedar rd.   \n",

The PROBLEM along this stretch of F.H. Ave is NOT that the road is too narrow; the problem is that vehicles' SPEED along this stretch causes grave danger to children and families who live in this neighborhood near Forest Hill Park. If anything, REDUCE the speed limit; add more paint/color to bike lane; and take any other measures to encourage commuters to use the downtown expressway/powhite. Widening this section of Forest Hill would be DANGEROUS to residents who need to cross the street to/from the park, churches, and the grade school located in this neighborhood.   \n",

If $12,000,000 of taxpayer money is burning a hole in your pocket, I'm certain we taxpayers could offer better uses, such as improved maintenance to existing roads, upgrading public utilities, or, dare I say, helping schools and businesses that have been impacted over the past year. Just my 2- centsâ€”which is far less than 12-million bucks, and so why you'll probably ignore it.   \n",

People already travel way too fast down Forest hill Ave and widening would just encourage speeding. Additionally, widening would encourage more people from out of the area to travel the road only increasing traffic issues. This is not a commuter road and is a local road to help local people get into the city. Funds should be used to remove the toll on the toll road in order to encourage people who do not live locally to actually use commuter roads.   \n",

No one in their right mind would change anything about the park.  $12 million 'Federal Grant'!!!  Use it somewhere else where it's needed.  This project is no needed or wanted.  It is not an improvement.  Does not improve the area.  In fact it would detract from the neighborhood.  Look at what they did in Stratford HIlls.

A widening plan would mean cutting down beautiful old trees, cutting into yards of historical homes and churches, a K through 7 school and an. all day nursery center.

Only the people coming from the county into the city for work would get to work a few minutes earlier - maybe.  Based on the performance of the road project through Stratford HIlls/Gravel Hills on Forest Hill, this proposed project would also take much longer to complete, not be completed as promised (no buried utility lines), nor be on budget.  Twelve million dollars definitely could be used to improve the roads in the neighborhood, which are in deplorable condition.  Also, it would be really nice if sidewalks were installed - a lot of streets lack this feature.  My husband and I have lived in Westover HIlls for 38 years.  We are adamantly opposed to widening Forest Hill Ave. This household will NOT vote for any politician who backs this proposal.  I cannot understand how anybody could think this idea was a good proposal.  Leave our neighborhood as it is - lovely.   \n",

Hopefully allow for more public transit in this area too. One thing I would say is I hope you all will consider adding additional signals at crosswalks along Semmes so that it is safer for pedestrians to cross the street, and other speed deterrants like speed bumps.

More lanes will increase the difficulty in crossing the street and for vehicles to enter the flow of traffic. We already have bike lanes. We have been named a historical area, and on a master plan have been named a most pleasing entry into the city. A widening plan would mean cutting down beautiful old trees, cutting into yards of historical homes and churches, a K through 7 school and an. all day nursery center. Parents using these facilities already have difficulty driving in and our of Forest Hill Ave. Please use the money on a project the city needs and its citizens want.   \n",

       "467     THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN! I am 15 years old, who lives right in front of the street. Every year there are accidents because people can't drive right and they speed through. It smells already when I walk the sidewalk, cars don't stop at the crosswalk for me. Widening the street will increase traffic, accidents, and noise. It will take big pieces of land of the park and houses/apartments. There are statistics that show widening roads makes traffic worse. Don't use $12 million for a tiny road, use it for your public transportation to help stop the carcentric America. If you want help prevent accidents in this area put protected bike lanes, cameras at the crosswalks to fine these drivers, and use the Amsterdam style by making raises crosswalks that act as a speed bump. This will tell drivers they're entering a pedestrian area. STOP PROTECTING CARS OVER WALKERS/BIKERS! People don't listen, so make the road were people will have to start paying attention. No passive actions, threaten w/ fines.   \n",

       "472     I am writing to state my extreme opposition to the widening of Forest Hill Ave from 47th Street to Semmes Ave. My husband and I live on FHA on the 4600 block and I can say with extreme confidence this project is a huge mistake. FHA is already an extremely dangerous road on this stretch with no stop signs or traffic lights. Since moving here in June of 2020, we have witnessed 5 car accidents and a pedestrian being struck by a vehicle right out front of our home - absolutely terrifying. The widening of FHA will not slow cars down nor make it safer for bikers and walkers, but will only encourage more traffic and dangerous driving maneuvers. We own a dog and I am already hesitant and scared to walk on FHA with the current large median because of the reckless driving. We will unfortunately be forced to move if this proposal goes through, and as you know, we certainly will not make the amount of money selling that we bought it for with the widening of this street. We want to stay in Forest H   \n",

       "476         I've already left a comment - however, there is an impression out there that the City has $12 million dollars in its budget to spend - that is, to tear apart this small stretch of historic Richmond street and park, rather than invest it in city schools. The $12 million is a grant from the Federal government - not the City. The city Traffic Engineer applied for the Federal grant, probably over 10 years ago (a guess).  If it is not used for this \"transportation\" project, then it is off the table. It's not an Educational Federal grant, so it doesn't have anything to do with schools. A terrible, blockhead idea.  Stroll along the blocks that they want to tear up - and you will realize that they will WITHOUT A DOUBT need to  bulldoze a chunk of everyone's beloved Forest Hill Park, from 42nd ST to Roanoke St. That is what they were going to do several years ago when they wanted to put in a roundabout at Roanoke - place the center of the roundabout inside the park - not under the traffic l   \n",

Widening roads increases trafﬁc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-trafﬁc-induced-demand/ Forest Hill Ave traffic is exceeding the road's capacity because drivers use it as a toll-free alternative to 195.

Make raised crosswalks that act as speed bumps (will make the driver know that they are in a pedestrian space/area), make continuous sidewalks, protected bike lanes so cars will stop going around other cars. Put a camera up on the crosswalks to stop people and fine them, the City will surely make money from that because we know they are broke. Fix the public transportation so we can get people out of the car and make people have options. Add a tram/streetcar back in the city for historic reasons and commuting and better transportation. And PLEASE stop building cheaply-built expensive apartments when you don't have jobs that can't pay that rent. You are causing overcrowding when you haven't even fixed your big issues like help low income communities that deeply need it.   \n",

The proposed section of Forest Hill Avenue to widen into four lanes is in the middle of the Historic Forest Hill neighborhood. A neighborhood, not a business thoroughfare or commercial highway, but a neighborhood. The widening of this section will increase traffic and speed as well as increasing risk to pedestrians who try to cross safely at pedestrian crossings and cyclists in bike lanes. This widening of the street will also have a negative impact on the arrival and departure of students at Good Shepherd School. Please utilize the monies for this project on road repair and repaving instead of widening a neighborhood Avenue.  Again,  I am greatly opposed to this proposal.   \n",

This is a wonderful designated historic neighborhood that people, even outside of the area, flock to in order to enjoy the sacred, peaceful and natural feel of FH park and JR parks area. This is NOT a four lane street type of area - this is an place for pedestrian enjoyment - one of the FEW left in RVA - the thought of ripping up these beautiful yards on FH and the old trees makes me so sad. Looks at the Stratford Hills stretch - 15 years of construction and now power poles in the median?! Awful!

It is already difficult to cross Forest Hill Avenue to get to one of our best resources, Forest Hill Park.  Even with two person activated cross-walk lights, MANY people do not stop making getting across the current two lanes very dangerous. This is a neighborhood with a historic designation. As other residents have indicated, we need measures to continue to calm traffic, not entice more people to take this short cut to avoid tolls. Have you considered working with RMTA to reduce tolls or provide a discounted rate for commuters to entice them to use better roads for commuting purposes. Even with the bike lanes, it is dangerous for bikers to travel or individuals who have the audacity to block traffic to make a left-hand turn onto their street.

       "496             Here's why we all need to find out what the Traffic Engineer is NOT telling us:  the proposed roundabout at Roanoke and Forest Hill was shelved several years ago because it involved digging out Forest Hill Park at that intersection, filing it with in-fill to raise it up to street level, and locating the center of the roundabout IN THE PARK - NOT UNDER THE TRAFFIC LIGHT, as you would (normally) assume. So that meant cars would careen around the roundabout INSIDE Forest Hill Park.  That is a main reason why 100% of the neighborhood voted NO to the multi-million roundabout several years ago. We all must be vigilant and ask very detailed questions, even seemingly off-the-wall questions, like:  \"exactly how much of Forest Hill Park are the Traffic Engineers going to bulldoze and infill with junk soil?\" Once it's gone, the peace and beauty of this little stretch of street is gone forever.   All because the the Traffic Engineer sees Forest Hill Avenue as a designated commuter highway.   \n",
       "497                      I am strongly opposed to the widening of Forest Hill Avenue between 47th Street and Semmes Avenue.  Speeding is already rampant in this area, and the enforcement of speeding laws appears to be nil.  As a GRTC user, I risk my life crossing from the north to south side of Forest Hill Avenue in the afternoon.  Due to lack of enforcement, there is no guarantee that cars will stop at the crosswalk at Forest Hill Avenue and W 43rd Street, and doubling the lanes will only increase the risk. In addition, I am concerned about the destruction of mature trees in the neighborhood and increased trafﬁc noise and air pollution. One of the stated justifications for this project is the addition of bike lanes.  However, there are already bike lanes between 47th Street and West Roanoke Road.  The remainder of the route abuts Forest Hill Park where additional bike lanes could be developed. In a post COVID world, where fewer folks are expected to commute to a downtown office, is this proje   \n",

In addition to the fact that the widening of Forest Hill Avenue would greatly disrupt the lives of the people who live on the street, those people who choose to live in this lovely neighborhood and pay their taxes to the city instead of fleeing to the suburbs, I have witnessed dangerous events because of the increased flow of traffic that commuters use as a cut through to downtown. When my son was in middle school, waiting at the school bus stop at Forest Hill Ave and W. 42nd Street with several other children, a car facing east was waiting to turn left onto W. 42nd Street.

I am struck that widening is being considered here - but not on River between Chippenham and Munford School, which is also single-lane but actually a notorious bottleneck (that I am often stuck in). This smells to me like having money-to-spend, and not spending it on real needs - for political reasons.

Not sure what this project is attempting to fix. The current traffic pattern is not causing a problem. The widening would diminish the character and charm of this section of Forest Hill Ave for little or no return. If this is only to provide four lanes through this section, then the return does not seem worth the expense and disruption this would cause. Please reconsider this project and use the funds for many other more necessary infrastructure needs in Richmond.   \n",

We need to slow traffic in this residential area, not widen it to a 4 lane highway. The traffic study done a few years ago is in direct opposition to this proposition. Seriously, where did this idea even come from? Do not cut into this historical neighborhood and park for the cost of 12 million dollars. Again... Why?!? To save 2 minutes on a commute? Not worth it. There are probably 12 million better ways to use this money in Richmond City.   \n",

Clearly a safety issue. Further, what an incredible waste of 12 million dollars. The streets in Richmond are in deplorable condition. Drive down our streets and look, really look, at their condition including the numerous patches. Additionally, the gas lines need attention, that is replacement, before the streets are repaved. Finally, we live here because of the character of the neighborhood. Why have a historic district if all that happens is that the city comes through and destroys that character? Scrap this project and use this money for more immediate repair needs.   \n",

Our parking lots are directly adjacent to the sidewalk and do not have room to give to widen the roads and taking from the park is destroying a historical property that the entire city enjoys and establishing the precedence that it is okay to do so in future situations. Furthermore, traffic is nowhere near heavy enough to warrant widening this road. If the city is so concerned with Forest Hill then start enforcing the speed limit and regulating the use of pedestrian crosswalks instead of increasing the danger our residents already face.   \n",
       "509                                      Where are comments made here going?  Is this the best place to comment on this terrible idea?  Would like to know who came up with this idea and why.  My husband and I have lived happily right off of Forest Hill near the park for over 45 years, our first house when we were young and now we are seniors.  We live right off the area mentioned for widening.  It is one of the wonderful and historic city neighborhoods and it is divided by Forest Hill and Semmes. Rather than widening Forest Hill, I would suggest changing Semmes in a way similar to what has recently been done in Malvern, going from 4 traffic lanes to 2 with bike lanes and turn lanes.  We don't want our neighborhood used as a thoroughfare for those trying to get downtown.  They need to be using the toll roads.  Someone needs to look into reducing or eliminating the tolls.  We already have people speeding through our neighborhood and we don't want to support them going even faster. Terrible idea.   \n",

I would also rather see that the right lane of FHA heading eastbound be changed to a right turn only lane at the FHA and Westover Hills Blvd intersection. Turn the extended lane on the east side of Westover HIlls Blvd into parking and protected bike lanes. The merge lane is often a race/contention area for traffic.   \n",

       "520                   Any such plan would be unacceptable, for many reasons: 1.Adding lanes actually will not ease trafﬁc pressure; it will *attract* more vehicular trafﬁc. 2.For pedestrians, crossing this section of Forest Hill Avenue is already difﬁcult.  Crossing four active traffic lanes would will be like taking our lives in our hands.  On 4-lane Semmes Avenue, the average speed is between 45 and 50 mph, regardless of the posted speed limit. 3.  Front yards on Forest Hill are small now and would be turned into mere slivers by this project. 4.  Excavation and construction to widen the bridge across Reedy Creek would damage the ecosystem and ﬁll Forest Hill Pond with silt. 5.  Widening of Forest Hill west of I-195 has taken years and is still ongoing.  The disruption and noise pollution created by the proposed project would create intolerable conditions for months or years. 6.  This project would destroy the character of a neighborhood that now attracts young taxpaying families to Richmond.   \n",

I vehemently object. A few years ago, there were plans to add traffic calming measures near the pedestrian crosswalks at 43rd st and 41st st. To improve safety and slow trafﬁc down. Remember that? Quite a change of direction here with this plan! This is a residential neighborhood. If cars want to use Forest Hill Avenue to access the city, so be it. But let those drivers deal with the current footprint of the road. Midlothian and Hull are already built to handle more traffic. The Powhite, Chippenham and I-195 are great options too. As a cyclist who rides daily, there is no way I am riding in a \"bike lane\" on a 4 way road as proposed. Save us the charade, that bike lane will do nothing to improve bike infrastructure and make cyclists feel more safe.   \n",

       "525                  This project does not appear to address the main issues associated with this road segment. Per VDOT data, and the state's VTRANS evaluation, the main issues on this stretch are pedestrian safety and minor peak-hour congestion at the traffic lights. These could be addressed through a much more limited scale projects that do not waste taxpayer dollars or harm the character of the neighborhood. Namely: 1. Trafﬁc lights could be added to create safe turning and crossing points and breaks in trafﬁc. 2. Peak-hour congestion heading west to the Roanoke Street could be addressed through a limited lane expansion from that intersection to the light at Semmes. This is also the only section in need of bike lanes. Expanding lanes from 47th to 41st street is unnecessary, and VTRANS rates that section as the lowest priority. 3. To address peak congestion, will need to expand Reedy Creek bridge, which carries 3 vehicle lanes and no bike lanes. The website map has project stopping earlier.   \n",

I am a resident on W 46th Street and I strongly oppose it. There is absolutely no need whatsoever for more lanes on this stretch of Forest Hill Ave, which is almost never congested at all. Crossing Forest Hill in the crosswalks is already unsafe due to atrocious pedestrian accommodations on the road; it is inconceivable to me that any serious person could think it's a good idea to add more lanes and make crossing even more dangerous. This is an expensive, thoughtless solution in search of a problem. Forest Hill Park is our life, and if this project proceeds, everyone in Forest Hill Terrace will be cut off from it. I am absolutely astounded that anyone thinks this is needed.   \n",

Adding two lanes will significantly increase the risk when it is already dangerous with just two lanes. 2) Would like to budget the funds to pave neighborhood roads and repair sidewalks. In my 22 years living in the neighborhood, our roads have only been patched. We need full paving of all roads and make our sidewalks safe to use. 3) Use the funds to enhance Forest Hill Park by renovating the bathrooms, repaving the tennis courts and repairing the picnic shelters.   \n",

What we need are stoplights to slow and break up traffic, not extra lanes to speed it up. The main problem is people crossing the street to get to the park or (in our case) my child crossing to get to school. Crossing Forest Hill on foot, or trying to make a left turn, is very dangerous, especially during rush hour. From what I see in Woodland Heights, adding lanes doesn't seem to break up traffic or make foot crossing/vehicle turning any easier. So this solution doesn't address the problem. It just messes up and divides our neighborhood and takes property away from dozens of city residents.   \n",

And of course the estimate, per-usual, is much much lower than it will actually cost. The businesses along that route will also be adversely affected during the  construction phase.

With the amount of speeding and volume of traffic, we feel unsafe on the sidewalks near the park as it is. Moreover, we have a serious problem with traffic speeding down our stretch of Forest Hill Ave after Semmes branches off. The speed limit here is 25, but we have seen so many unnecessary high-speed collisions on our street. This is a residential area, and we need speed bumps and 4-way stop signs. Increasing the volume of traffic on Forest Hill Ave near the park would only exacerbate traffic problems in the surrounding neighborhood and make residents less likely to use and enjoy the park.

       "541          I am unequivocally opposed to the proposal to widen Forest Hill Avenue to four lanes plus bike lanes.  Forest Hill neighborhood is a state-designated historic district and an attractive gateway to the city.  The avenue serves as a neighborhood corridor for joggers, families with children, dog walkers, and cyclists.  It supports walkability to local neighborhood restaurants and businesses.  The proposal would threaten the activities that define the neighborhood such as Music in the Park, the 43rd St Art Festival, SOTJ Market, the FH 5K run, and of course family sledding in the park in winter!  As a homeowner on FHA, I witness traffic speeding WELL over the 30 mph limit as well as frequently ignoring the flashing lights at designated pedestrian crossings.  Rather than widening to increase traffic volume as well as risks to safety, city resources would be better spent to enforce existing speed limits and pedestrian crossing along with protecting the historic character of Forest Hill.   \n",

What this greater section of FHA could benefit from are buffers to slow the speed of traffic rather than encouraging higher volumes (and speeds) of traffic. Having lived on FHA for over a decade 2007-2018 I can directly speak to the unfortunate transformation of this charming avenue becoming a breeze through for commuters.This is understandable, but the integrity of the Avenue's unique characteristics should most surely be maintained and lower speeds encouraged. Let's focus on keeping the charm that makes this such a desirable neighborhood.   \n",

This is an historic district and Forest Hill Ave does not need to be widened.  Drive down what is down a lovely avenue and imagine how many homeowner's yards will be lopped off by widening this section of Forest Hill. Traffic flows just fine now.  It does not need \"added capacity\".  Wasn't that the point of the Expressway?  What happened to family friendly neighborhoods.  My daughter and her family live off Forest Hill and are already suffering from the added use of James River Park.  Imagine the disruption of the neighborhood for the 3-4 years it would take to complete this kind of project (think Powhite to Chippenham).  This would be a total nightmare and a waste of money.

This project will negatively impact all of us who live in this part of Richmond and diminish the value of our property. It will especially diminish the neighborhood feel that we now have without a 4 lane road going through the middle of the area. Sylvia Clute   \n",

The size of Forest Hill Ave should be left as it is, and made safer through enforcement of the posted speed limit and safe pedestrian crosswalks. Thanks.   \n",

There is already a speeding problem that endangers walkers and pedestrians trying to cross FHA in our neighborhood. Even with the lighted crossing signal at 43rd Street there has been at least one near fatal pedestrian accident right there. The nature of this two lane stretch is the only thing that keeps traffic from going even faster. My guess is that the project is driven by disgruntled drivers who do not live in our district - they just want to speed through it even faster than they already do... and that is darned fast. Spend the money on more and safer crossings for residents, neighborhood school students and bus riders!   \n",
       "547         I am irate this has even been proposed. It would destroy the charm of a historic neighborhood and ruin property values along the construction corridor, especially in the blocks between 41st and 44th Streets. It would also increase traffic through the neighborhood streets that connect to Riverside Drive, like 42nd Street, simply because widening will invite greater traffic levels. You have Woodland Heights residents who have reduced the speed limit on Semmes and now you are planning to increase the number of cars funneling into that area?!  Not to mention the impact to Reedy Creek and the Park. We put in cross walk signs not too long ago and now you want to make the road even more challenging for to pedestrians to cross?! Sometimes the most acceptable thing to do to manage traffic is to do nothing. That deters people from relying on it as a primary route. Additionally, invest in an updated study, since your data is pre-COVID and before the telecommuting trend. Spend the $ elsewhere.   \n",

There is no need to add lanes, this is not a congested area. The houses on Forest Hill Avenue would lose the buffer they have between their living space and the busy road. It would most likely make it less walkable. We need measures to increase walkability, not to increase convenience of auto traffic. I have driven that stretch of FHA for 23 years and it hasn't gotten any more busy or congested, in my opinion. And how would you increase the capacity on the bridge over Reedy Creek right at the intersection of Semmes and Forest Hill Ave??? You most likely couldn't, so you would have major back-ups there as a bottle- neck situation would be created. Add more protected and clearly outlined pedestrian crossing and leave the width of the road alone.   \n",

       "553     I oppose this project.The number of cars should be reduced not increased. The city Police has ignored our requests to enforce the 30 mile per hour speed limit. For years have we suffered that cars speed up before cross walks rather than slow down and stop for pedestrians. The worst example for the widening is Semmes Ave between W 34th Street  and Cowardin Avenue. Cars drive constantly 10 and more miles per hour over the speed limit of 30 m p. hr. There are police cars sometimes. But the police catches perhaps 1 out 50 speeding cars. The norm there is that cars are constantly driving way too fast on 4 lanes. The major feeding arteries to the city should not go through a residential district which is historic and recreational. The parks close to Forest Hill Ave attract families with children and bikers who will be exposed to more traffic and more danger. There are churches and a school who are mostly reached by foot. There are children and and a lot of elderly residents. Not a race track   \n",

Marina Alexander, resident I strongly oppose the project. I gave my reasons below but there is also the pollution and noise. More cars equal more pollution and more noise that we residents are exposed to. The amount of speeding cars will be doubled at least. Why is Route 60, Midlothian Turnpike, not widened and brought back to its original purpose? It is a major artery and goes from 6 lanes to 2 lanes. That road could just continue to bring traffic to Cowardin Ave into the city and it goes partly through old commercial buildings. It might bring new live into that area and give the city an incentive to revive this stretch of Midlothian Avenue.   \n",
       "555      I strongly oppose this project. When you look at Semmes Ave between the Patrick Henry School and Cowardin Ave you see that a four lane road only increases the number of speeding cars, more danger to residents young and old crossing the road, more noise, more pollution and the Police unable to control the speeding. I see it all the time that cars are constantly driving at least 10 miles over the speed limit. We don't need this in a historic, residential and recreational neighborhood. Stop lights are only minimally able to reduce these hazards and maximally increase the noise and the pollution. Instead, the City should turn Midlothian Turnpike, Route 60,Â  from Westover Hills Blvd to Cowarding into the same size as it is west of that stretch and relieve Forest Hill Ave of unnecessary traffic.

Currently, there is a lot of traffic on Forest Hill, but widening the road would increase that dramatically.  With the wider lanes, more people would stop using the Downtown Expressway and cut through the neighborhood.  And it is a neighborhood! This would reduce the value of homes in the area and change its character.  It's already difficult to cross Forest Hill Ave, either walking or driving, and this would complicate it. There are many lovely homes on that part of Forest Hill. With smaller yards and a busier street, the values go down and the sense of neighborhood is lost.

       "559       Any proposal to widen this portion of Forest Hill Avenue is misplaced at best. Yes, there is congestion during peak drive times but the congestion is not unreasonable considering the volume of traffic already present.

There is insufficient enforcement, if any, of speed limits in the area as it is and this proposal will only exacerbate the problems already present with diver's behaviors. Pedestrians, even with the flashing light crossings already present, take enough risk trying to traverse the width of Forest Hill now. If improvements are considered for this section of roadway I would suggest a center turn lane, at most to improve flow but do not see the benefit to enlarging to four lanes. Too much of a negative  impact to the historic nature and feel of the area would be incurred by residents for very little return to commuters.   \n",
       "560         I strongly oppose this project. I have lived close to this proposed project for 30+ years.  Most of the day this two lane section is perfectly adequate for the amount of auto traffic. Rush hour traffic congestion on FH Avenue is caused primarily by commuters who could use the Downtown Expressway and Powhite Parkway to reach their destination, but prefer to travel on FH Avenue to avoid the tolls.  This project would encourage more rush hour traffic as well as speeding during other hours.  Increasing the roadway to four lanes would significantly degrade safe access for pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers from neighborhoods south of FH Avenue to Forest Hill Park, Good Shepherd Church and School and Forest Hill Presbyterian Church located on the northside of FH Avenue. Traffic calming, pedestrian and cycling safety improvements should be undertaken as well as investment in improved transit service not this project to increase vehicle capacity in this vibrant historic residential area!   \n",

I am 81 years old.  I could have moved years ago, but I love my 1925 house, yard, garden spot and this lovely old neighborhood.When I moved here in 1970, neighbors had ponies and chickens and a rooster that woke me in the morning.  You could hear the train whistle passing along the river, and still can.  I used to walk to Forest Hill Park every afternoon, and to the James River before it became a park.  In the winter, we went sledding on the long hill that parallels Forest Hill Avenue, and in those days skating on the lake in Forest Hill Park. Little has changed. Forest Hill was listed on the State and National registers as a historic district in 2012.  It was advertised as Country-in-the-City lving in the 1920s.  Do not destroy this historic neighborhood by widening Forest Hill Ave.   \n",
       "563          As a resident of the Forest Hill neighborhood I am opposed to the widening of Forest Hill Ave from 47th to Semmes Ave as identified on the map.  Removal of trees from the urban forest will continue to reduce the many ecoservices trees provide including CO2 absorption and O2 production,  cooling of the urban landscape, soil health, and providing animal and plant habitat. In addition, the widening of the road will increase speed and traffic volume in this area impacting the biking and pedestrian community due to safety concerns. The historic character and designation of the neighborhood including Forest Hill Park will be adversely impacted by this project. Based on the widening of other sections of Forest Hill Ave, construction impacts to the neighborhood from the project  would last for several months or even years. I agree with others that the $12,000,000 estimated for the proposed project could be utilized for other city priorities including safety improvements and reforestation.   \n",

It would be an absolute travesty to see this road changed to allow additional traffic. If congestion is the problem, consider reducing the tolls for cars to use the main highways which already bifurcate the city. By allowing better access to these already existing roads, congestion will decrease in our neighborhood and we can focus on increasing pedestrian, bike, and mass transit opportunities throughout this area.   \n",

I drive on this stretch all the time and see no need to widen the road. There's already two lanes approaching the key intersections (eastbound approach the light at 4th/I-95 entrance and westbound approaching Maury). Traffic backs up because of the lights, not some other reason. The I-95 entrance is already getting fixed with a roundabout and I've never had a big enough backup at Maury Street that I missed the light.   \n",

This is a historic road and need to stay as it is. There is no need for development and sprawl in the east end like has occurred in Short Pump. We need farms and open spaces.  Instead of developing the Varina area  take the run down areas and redevelop them.  Also as we look at climate control and pollution adding more asphalt and development in Varina will have more negative effects on the environment.   \n",

Vocal and well supported reasons that this is both unnecessary and destructive to the corridor have been outlined numerous times over the years.  Widening Rt 5 would have a serious negative impact on the adjacent neighborhoods, historic and environmental resources, and the well-used Capital Trail.  This proposal needs to be permanently removed from consideration.   Please use that money to support K-12 education in the same area.   \n",

Just look at Short Pump to see how things can be ruined by building infrastructure that is all about cars. We fortunately already have wonderful pedestrian and biking accommodations called the Capital Trail.  Adding auto lanes to this historic road would destroy what we have worked so long and hard to protect and for what? A jam up when you reach Rockkets Landing.   \n",

Aside from the farmland that would be acquired from families to expand the road ridding this area of its natural beauty. There are multiple man-made structures on both sides of the road. How will people residing in these residences be impacted by the widening of the road? Due to safety regulations, they will have to sell their house and property to the county for a devalued price and move somewhere else. Not only lowering property values but driving longtime residents away from their community. I understand that people are looking to expand the number of people living on this side of Henrico but there needs to be a better conversation about it with more community input.   \n",

The lack of need for the widening of these roads is indisputable. Varina is beautiful for the open fields and winding country roads. Why would we take away from the investment of the Capital Trail with the expansion plans for Route 5? Wouldn't money be better spent on the Eastern Henrico School System? Millions of dollars invested should have a better return if spent on the community itself.   \n",

Road widening does not create safer roads, and this proposal will ultimately lead to increased congestion, higher speeds, and sprawl throughout eastern Henrico county.   \n",

As others have noted, there are also ridiculously deep potholes in these neighborhoods that just never get fixed; please spend funds improving the community's quality of life rather than detracting from it.</td>\n",

Believe me, I know: While I live on a fairly quiet street, it's used as a through street to Westover Hills Blvd. and people speed on it all the time. In 3 years, I've seen five accidents, including four cars totaled (including my own), so speeding has real-life impact (no pun intended). It's a miracle no people or pets have been hurt. Not to mention what this Forest Hill project would do to the homeowners' yards who live along that stretch. Use the $$ for mass transit and/or more traffic calming / traffic cops.

It is not needed & will only lead to sprawling development which is not what Varina is or wants to become. It is a unique rural area that needs to grow in a responsible way that keeps the character of the area.   \n",

You will be destroying our property values and the look of an older neighborhood that's trying it's best to get on its feet. Do you know how hard people work on improving their community around here? Could the city make it any more clear they don't care about the southside?  We may not be The Fan, but just because we have the lower property values, doesn't mean we don't count! FOUR LANES IN A HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD will cause a speed way, risking lives of residents and kids and pets, destroying the historic nature of the neighborhood and devastating home values.   \n",

       "275                             This section of Forest Hill Avenue runs through the Forest Hill neighborhood, designated as a national historic district.  This proposal would have a negative impact on this historic and beautiful neighborhood.  The neighborhood was one of Richmond's early \"Street Car suburbs.\" It seems a sad irony to destroy this neighborhood to advantage those in today's automobile suburbs at a time when the age of the automobile is ending. There are two churches on this stretch.  One of them houses a school and the other an early- childhood learning facility.  There is a high volume of pedestrian traffic, and crossing Forest Hill Avenue is already very difficult for residents of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Although the speed limit was recently reduced to 30 miles an hour, and two crossing lights have been installed (one at 41st and one at 43rd) crossing remains a hazard, as drivers ignore the lights and travel well above the speed limit. I strongly oppose this project.   \n",

People already drive way too fast down forest hill, and pedestrian crossing is already difficult with two lanes. Current bike lanes are adequate, and we need to be more concerned with pedestrian and neighbor interests than those of vehicle drivers commuting through the area. Moving to four lanes would only increase speeding down forest hill, which is not safe for desired by residents.   \n",

We do not need YEARS of construction and destruction to help some during rush hour.  There are numerous alternatives to downtown  for the bulk of the traffic. Do not destroy the beautiful nature of this neighborhood.  It always pleases me to get to this portion of the road as I get close to home.  It doesn't need to look like another downtown city street.  I find the traffic a bit much sometimes as well but one improvement would be to better coordinate the lights at Roanoke and Semmes so the traffic moves seamlessly. I know, the city finds that almost impossible to do. And while I'm at it, stop with the traffic circles.  I have some near me that are literally 5 feet across. Really? Also, stop giving up 100's of parking spaces and a lane of traffic for the same 20 bicyclists use in Richmond (Franklin St.).   \n",

The only thing slowing cars down is the change from 4 lanes to 2 lanes at 47th street. Because of the dangerous drivers in the area, the speed limit was just recently reduced to 30 mph and  pedestrian crossing was put in after a young child was hit in front of Good Shepherd Episcopal School. This is a terrible idea and I'm strongly opposed!   \n",

There are plenty of places to ride bikes that are not adjacent to this very busy road. Riverside drive comes to mind in this stretch. Forest Hill is a terrible road for bikes and these projects only make the area harder to navigate for cars and people. Terrible waste of money and if you want to see a complete mess, you need only see what is being built on the FH stretch from Willow Oaks to the Food Lion. All that money and effort to make it even more dangerous to turn on or off FH, and the poles in the middle will likely cause many accidents and deaths. What a mess. Learn from it and don't do this project.   \n",

The road does not need to be widened. It needs a reduced speed rate and speed bumps. This is a residential area with many people's homes and apartments  on Forest Hill Avenue. Many pedestrians use this area and need to cross forest hill avenue on a regular basis One little boy was already almost killed crossing at a crosswalk. Widening the road and adding more lanes will just encourage more speeding and cut through traffic.  We should not widen this road. We need more crosswalks.   \n",

I STRONGLY OPPOSE widening this section of Forest Hill Avenue. (1) Many houses, like mine, on this section of Forest Hill are already close to the street, and taking much of our front yard would leave our house uncomfortably close to the street, which will have even more traffic. The impact on home owners of reducing our already small front yards would be even more negative than the impacts on those homeowners further west on the section of Forest Hill where street widening is still ongoing. (2) While traffic increases at rush hour, this is not a real problem. Widening Forest Hill might be expected to reduce commute time by perhaps 5 minutes, not a substantial benefit to the city and resulting in significant harm to the home owners (and voters) who would be negatively affected.   \n",

This section of Forest Hill has a number of historic properties and is part of an urban neighborhood center. There is already a high volume of speeding traffic on the roadway as well as existing bike lanes, making it difficult to leave the neighborhood as well as cross streets in and out of the park area. The area would be better served by a road diet - using traffic calming such as wider curb cuts, traffic circles and lights to slow traffic coming off the FH exit of 195. The majority of traffic is seeking to elude tolls on 195 going downtown from outer suburbs - why should we privilege them while hurting residents and reducing property values in an older residential neighborhood?   \n",

We bought on FHA to live in the gorgeous neighborhood close to nature and the river. A NEIGHBORHOOD - not a highway! We will unfortunately definitely sell and most likely not get our full value for the house due to this road widening. We beg the city not to do this. Leave the south side alone!!! We want small businesses and neighborhood vibes not 4 lane highways and casinos!! Get that through your heads!!!   \n",

I have commuted on Forest Hill Ave. my entire life and it gets a normal amount of congestion during rush hour, but nothing that would warrant this project. As a life-long Richmond resident, I have always found this district to be aesthetically pleasing and psychologically uplifting to drive through. On the other hand, driving down roads like Broad St. and Midlothian Tnpk., cause a great deal of psychological stress. People who choose to live in Southside, are there because they do not want to live in a high traffic, commercialized environment. This is why they pay the elevated taxes that they do, to the city. And now, the city decides they can simply come in and ruin the property value, which is likely these families' primary investment. We will not stand for it.   \n",

Has someone actually measured the current frontage?  If sidewalks are to remain, they would have to be placed through my front porch. There are two times during a business day when traffic is â€œheavyâ€ - morning and evening commutes.   The real problem is badly timed stop lights at Roanoke and Seemes and school crossing issues - adding two additional lanes will not solve the true problem. Besides eight hours of light \"congestion\", the other 160 hours of the week traffic moves along very nicely, in fact, to nicely - like 45-50 miles per hour in a 35 mph zone.  How about some speed bumps? Does the cost include property value losses?  This plan has obviously not been thought out. Our neighborhood is prepared to engage in legal actions and recourse including compensation for property value losses. This plan is insane, stupid, misguided, and horrible.   \n",

Also the homes and apartments along this stretch are set very close to the street. This area is not meant to be a 4 lane highway to support commuters!

It is NOT the responsibility of the City of Richmond, nor its residents, to provide smooth commuting times to suburban residents! Current trends predict more and more people moving into the City and away from the suburbs -- so widening the road would be short sighted. This movement into the city coupled with predictions that many workers will continue to work from home offices for decades after the pandemic make the proposed changes unnecessary! Enlarging this road would be detrimental to one of the City's most livable and historic neighborhoods -- which has the best forest canopy of all the City's neighborhoods. The loss of mature trees and increase of road surface would increase area temperatures and result in loss of native birds and additional wildlife. Finally, the projected cost of $12,000,000 would be better spent on improving REGIONAL mass transit options.   \n",

We have walkers, joggers, bikers, kids, dogs and cats on our avenue. Making it four lanes will create so much danger for everyone who lives there just so Chesterfield folks can get to work 3 minutes faster.

It's mainly for benefit of commuters who don't live in the neighborhood or even the city â€“ they can use Powhite or Midlothian Tpke. More traffic/higher speeds will increase accidents. Believe me, I know: While I live on a fairly quiet street, it's used as a through street to Westover Hills Blvd. and people speed on it all the time. In 3 years, I've seen five accidents, including four cars totaled (including my own), so speeding has real-life impact (no pun intended). It's a miracle no people or pets have been hurt. Not to mention what this Forest Hill project would do to the homeowners' yards who live along that stretch. Use the $$ for mass transit and/or more traffic calming / traffic cops.

       "378             I moved to Forest Hill 12 years ago because it had charm - an historic area that developed as a respite from the bustle of city. There are mature trees, beautiful homes, and the sounds of train whistles. It's a place to slow down and to appreciate the beauty around us. I strongly oppose the widening of Forest Hill Avenue between 47th Street and Semmes Avenue. It will harm the residents as well as ruin what is left of the charm here. It will cause property values to plummet. What problem is sought to be remedied?  There is, at most, heavier traffic during normal rush hours that might result in a minutes longer commute than during other times of the day. Widening the road will encourage more people to cut through the neighborhood. Soon there will be the same slowdowns during rush hour but with more cars.  Aren't there actual problems that need focus? The money could be better used to serve the residents here through other projects. Don't turn Forest Hill Avenue into a thruway.   \n",

       "393                        I oppose this project adding cars, pollution and impermeable pavement: 1) Our neighborhood has asked for speed bumps, circles and protected bike lanes. And we've asked for *less cars*. To 'bucket' two opposing solutions together almost as a one-or-known, is unfair and may come across manipulative. What's up, RVA? 2) While you think *the space* exists, it doesn't. If you respect your people rebuilding RVA, this road is not a 4-laner. I'd argue how might it be *a one way*. This unique, quaint section should be realized now for its value. Like Church Hill, it's historic. 3) I believe it's worth considering Westover Ave, Hull St, Midlo Ave and other Semmes connection points with existing infrastructure to better use millions of $. What gives? 4) Community design. Forest Hill Terrace and residents north of Midlothian are a part of the Forest Hill neighborhood, too.

I have never actually experienced traffic, and I'm not too sure why we should spend $12 million dollars on this project. What about the beauty of the neighborhood streets? Trees that were planted with tax dollars--so, they're just supposed to be uprooted and removed for some perceived idea of a better flow of traffic? Take away a part of people's yards to make room for traffic? Certainly, there could be a better use of taxpayer dollars to other projects that could make a beneficial change. Education, for one.   \n",

Forest Hill Avenue does NOT need to be widened. Traffic counts don't warrant it. We need to slow traffic, not add more cars going faster. It seems like every time a road project is completed in this area, it is a waste of money and effort. The \"traffic calming circles\" are a joke. People still speed down W. 47th; the circle closest to my house has been damaged by speeders at least twice. How about you spend that $12 million where it's needed, rather than wasting it on marring a beautiful stretch of road through a designated HISTORIC area?   \n",

Adding more lanes only adds more cars, traffic, congestion and accidents. A 4 lane Forest Hill Avenue will make it nearly impossible for pedestrians and bikers to cross (read: families and their children).  This is a poorly developed plan with little to no community outreach; hence the overwhelmingly opposition.   \n",

It would cause more traffic congestion, not alleviate it because it would encourage more people to use it as a commuter route. The city and VDOT proposed changes to Forest Hill Ave would turn the road into a highway with cars traveling at higher speeds making it less safe.

There are already bike lanes that see relatively little use. It is not necessary to destroy property values and the charm of an historic district for a faster commute. Property values have continued to rise in this neighborhood because people want to live here for the charm, the quiet, the convenient location, and proximity to Forest Hill Park and the James River. Drivers don't honor the 30mph speed limit or the pedestrian crossing lights as it is now. What will it be like at 4 lanes? Oh, wait...most of the time there probably won't be any more traffic there is currently! What a waste of money and a disregard for the quality of life for this community.

Like many have said before this comment, this will encourage increased speeds and harm the slower pace and charm of the neighborhood. I don't think anyone enjoys a busier road especially one that does not have an obvious need to be widened. Ultimately, this would have pedestrians and cyclists interacting with faster and certainly more dangerous traffic. Semmes is already bad enough and this seems like it would be similar to what Semmes is now. I'm a a Southside resident and home owner.   \n",

       "429                           I am very opposed to the proposed expenditure of $12,000,000 to widen Forest Hill Avenue. The costs to those who live on and near that section of Forest Hill Avenue are immeasurable. Safety is already a grave concern there, evidenced by the number of serious accidents occurring, often causing pedestrian and motor vehicle occupant injury. The inevitable reduction in the value and appearances of many homes impacts the city as a whole, as well as that neighborhood. Instead of using those funds on an expansion that will cause even more accidents, and have a deleterious impact on property values, spend it on removing tolls from some of the local city roads. People speed along Forest Hill Avenue, as well as Semmes Avenue during their daily comments, unaware of the impacts on local residents.

The neighborhood is a city treasure, and running more traffic at a higher volume right through the heart of it would be disastrous!  Pedestrians have already been seriously injured on the stretch. There are close by corridors with plenty of capacity to channel traffic safely through the area. Corridors which were designed for that purpose. Midlothian Turnpike, the Downtown expressway. We do not need another major artery dissecting a historical neighborhood and jewel city park so folks can shave 2 minutes off their  commute to the counties.   \n",

The PROBLEM along this stretch of F.H. Ave is NOT that the road is too narrow; the problem is that vehicles' SPEED along this stretch causes grave danger to children and families who live in this neighborhood near Forest Hill Park. If anything, REDUCE the speed limit; add more paint/color to bike lane; and take any other measures to encourage commuters to use the downtown expressway/powhite. Widening this section of Forest Hill would be DANGEROUS to residents who need to cross the street to/from the park, churches, and the grade school located in this neighborhood.   \n",

If $12,000,000 of taxpayer money is burning a hole in your pocket, I'm certain we taxpayers could offer better uses, such as improved maintenance to existing roads, upgrading public utilities, or, dare I say, helping schools and businesses that have been impacted over the past year. Just my 2- centsâ€”which is far less than 12-million bucks, and so why you'll probably ignore it.   \n",

People already travel way too fast down Forest hill Ave and widening would just encourage speeding. Additionally, widening would encourage more people from out of the area to travel the road only increasing traffic issues. This is not a commuter road and is a local road to help local people get into the city. Funds should be used to remove the toll on the toll road in order to encourage people who do not live locally to actually use commuter roads.   \n",

Our family has lived in Westover Hills since 1979 and has always appreciated the historic character and the pedestrian-friendly amenities of the neighborhoods around Forest Hill Avenue and Forest Hill Park.  Widening Forest Hill Avenue from 47th Street to Semmes Avenue to promote more and faster commuter traffic is a terrible idea and a waste of money.  Fix the potholes and repair our sidewalks instead.  Make this a livable city for all of the young families moving in!   \n",

       "472  I am writing to state my extreme opposition to the widening of Forest Hill Ave from 47th Street to Semmes Ave. My husband and I live on FHA on the 4600 block and I can say with extreme confidence this project is a huge mistake. FHA is already an extremely dangerous road on this stretch with no stop signs or traffic lights. Since moving here in June of 2020, we have witnessed 5 car accidents and a pedestrian being struck by a vehicle right out front of our home - absolutely terrifying. The widening of FHA will not slow cars down nor make it safer for bikers and walkers, but will only encourage more traffic and dangerous driving maneuvers. We own a dog and I am already hesitant and scared to walk on FHA with the current large median because of the reckless driving. We will unfortunately be forced to move if this proposal goes through, and as you know, we certainly will not make the amount of money selling that we bought it for with the widening of this street.

Widening roads increases trafﬁc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand https://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-trafﬁc-induced-demand/ Forest Hill Ave traffic is exceeding the road's capacity because drivers use it as a toll-free alternative to 195. It's a much better idea to remove the toll from 195 to incentivize drivers to use that much larger road more often, and to put this cross-town traffic where capacity already exists.   \n",

The proposed section of Forest Hill Avenue to widen into four lanes is in the middle of the Historic Forest Hill neighborhood. A neighborhood, not a business thoroughfare or commercial highway, but a neighborhood. The widening of this section will increase traffic and speed as well as increasing risk to pedestrians who try to cross safely at pedestrian crossings and cyclists in bike lanes. This widening of the street will also have a negative impact on the arrival and departure of students at Good Shepherd School. Please utilize the monies for this project on road repair and repaving instead of widening a neighborhood Avenue.  Again,  I am greatly opposed to this proposal.   \n",

       "497                   I am strongly opposed to the widening of Forest Hill Avenue between 47th Street and Semmes Avenue.  Speeding is already rampant in this area, and the enforcement of speeding laws appears to be nil.  As a GRTC user, I risk my life crossing from the north to south side of Forest Hill Avenue in the afternoon.  Due to lack of enforcement, there is no guarantee that cars will stop at the crosswalk at Forest Hill Avenue and W 43rd Street, and doubling the lanes will only increase the risk. In addition, I am concerned about the destruction of mature trees in the neighborhood and increased trafﬁc noise and air pollution. One of the stated justifications for this project is the addition of bike lanes.  However, there are already bike lanes between 47th Street and West Roanoke Road.  The remainder of the route abuts Forest Hill Park where additional bike lanes could be developed. In a post COVID world, where fewer folks are expected to commute to a downtown office, is this proje   \n",

Clearly a safety issue. Further, what an incredible waste of 12 million dollars. The streets in Richmond are in deplorable condition. Drive down our streets and look, really look, at their condition including the numerous patches. Additionally, the gas lines need attention, that is replacement, before the streets are repaved.

       "520                Any such plan would be unacceptable, for many reasons: 1.Adding lanes actually will not ease trafﬁc pressure; it will *attract* more vehicular trafﬁc. 2.For pedestrians, crossing this section of Forest Hill Avenue is already difﬁcult.  Crossing four active traffic lanes would will be like taking our lives in our hands.  On 4-lane Semmes Avenue, the average speed is between 45 and 50 mph, regardless of the posted speed limit. 3.  Front yards on Forest Hill are small now and would be turned into mere slivers by this project. 4.  Excavation and construction to widen the bridge across Reedy Creek would damage the ecosystem and ﬁll Forest Hill Pond with silt. 5.  Widening of Forest Hill west of I-195 has taken years and is still ongoing.

I vehemently object. A few years ago, there were plans to add traffic calming measures near the pedestrian crosswalks at 43rd st and 41st st. To improve safety and slow trafﬁc down. Remember that? Quite a change of direction here with this plan! This is a residential neighborhood. If cars want to use Forest Hill Avenue to access the city, so be it. But let those drivers deal with the current footprint of the road. Midlothian and Hull are already built to handle more traffic. The Powhite, Chippenham and I-195 are great options too.

This is an expensive, thoughtless solution in search of a problem. Forest Hill Park is our life, and if this project proceeds, everyone in Forest Hill Terrace will be cut off from it.

Adding two lanes will significantly increase the risk when it is already dangerous with just two lanes. 2) Would like to budget the funds to pave neighborhood roads and repair sidewalks. In my 22 years living in the neighborhood, our roads have only been patched.

My family lives at 31st and Forest Hill Ave, and we already feel unsafe walking to the park with our child. The traffic at the intersection of Semmes and Forest Hill Ave is already out of control. With the amount of speeding and volume of traffic, we feel unsafe on the sidewalks near the park as it is. Moreover, we have a serious problem with traffic speeding down our stretch of Forest Hill Ave after Semmes branches off. The speed limit here is 25, but we have seen so many unnecessary high-speed collisions on our street. This is a residential area, and we need speed bumps and 4-way stop signs. Increasing the volume of traffic on Forest Hill Ave near the park would only exacerbate traffic problems in the surrounding neighborhood and make residents less likely to use and enjoy the park.

       "541       I am unequivocally opposed to the proposal to widen Forest Hill Avenue to four lanes plus bike lanes.  Forest Hill neighborhood is a state-designated historic district and an attractive gateway to the city.  The avenue serves as a neighborhood corridor for joggers, families with children, dog walkers, and cyclists.  It supports walkability to local neighborhood restaurants and businesses.  The proposal would threaten the activities that define the neighborhood such as Music in the Park, the 43rd St Art Festival, SOTJ Market, the FH 5K run, and of course family sledding in the park in winter!  As a homeowner on FHA, I witness traffic speeding WELL over the 30 mph limit as well as frequently ignoring the flashing lights at designated pedestrian crossings.  Rather than widening to increase traffic volume as well as risks to safety, city resources would be better spent to enforce existing speed limits and pedestrian crossing along with protecting the historic character of Forest Hill.   \n",

What this greater section of FHA could benefit from are buffers to slow the speed of traffic rather than encouraging higher volumes (and speeds) of traffic. Having lived on FHA for over a decade 2007-2018 I can directly speak to the unfortunate transformation of this charming avenue becoming a breeze through for commuters.This is understandable, but the integrity of the Avenue's unique characteristics should most surely be maintained and lower speeds encouraged. Let's focus on keeping the charm that makes this such a desirable neighborhood.   \n",

The size of Forest Hill Ave should be left as it is, and made safer through enforcement of the posted speed limit and safe pedestrian crosswalks. Thanks.   \n",
       "547      I am irate this has even been proposed. It would destroy the charm of a historic neighborhood and ruin property values along the construction corridor, especially in the blocks between 41st and 44th Streets. It would also increase traffic through the neighborhood streets that connect to Riverside Drive, like 42nd Street, simply because widening will invite greater traffic levels. You have Woodland Heights residents who have reduced the speed limit on Semmes and now you are planning to increase the number of cars funneling into that area?!  Not to mention the impact to Reedy Creek and the Park. We put in cross walk signs not too long ago and now you want to make the road even more challenging for to pedestrians to cross?! Sometimes the most acceptable thing to do to manage traffic is to do nothing. That deters people from relying on it as a primary route. Additionally, invest in an updated study, since your data is pre-COVID and before the telecommuting trend. Spend the $ elsewhere.   \n",

This plan would destroy the character of the neighborhood, will not provide safety, will intrude on Forest Hill Park, take out homes or destroy their value, and destroy local and popular businesses. There are already bike lanes in this area, so this is just a gesture. \"Increased capacity\" is not good for this part of Richmond. A better plan would be to find ways to get commuters on the RMA so they don't go through a residential neighborhood.   \n",

       "553  I oppose this project.The number of cars should be reduced not increased. The city Police has ignored our requests to enforce the 30 mile per hour speed limit. For years have we suffered that cars speed up before cross walks rather than slow down and stop for pedestrians. The worst example for the widening is Semmes Ave between W 34th Street  and Cowardin Avenue. Cars drive constantly 10 and more miles per hour over the speed limit of 30 m p. hr. There are police cars sometimes. But the police catches perhaps 1 out 50 speeding cars. The norm there is that cars are constantly driving way too fast on 4 lanes. The major feeding arteries to the city should not go through a residential district which is historic and recreational. The parks close to Forest Hill Ave attract families with children and bikers who will be exposed to more traffic and more danger. There are churches and a school who are mostly reached by foot. There are children and and a lot of elderly residents. Not a race track   \n",

Marina Alexander, resident I strongly oppose the project. I gave my reasons below but there is also the pollution and noise. More cars equal more pollution and more noise that we residents are exposed to. The amount of speeding cars will be doubled at least. Why is Route 60, Midlothian Turnpike, not widened and brought back to its original purpose? It is a major artery and goes from 6 lanes to 2 lanes. That road could just continue to bring traffic to Cowardin Ave into the city and it goes partly through old commercial buildings. It might bring new live into that area and give the city an incentive to revive this stretch of Midlothian Avenue.   \n",
       "555   I strongly oppose this project. When you look at Semmes Ave between the Patrick Henry School and Cowardin Ave you see that a four lane road only increases the number of speeding cars, more danger to residents young and old crossing the road, more noise, more pollution and the Police unable to control the speeding. I see it all the time that cars are constantly driving at least 10 miles over the speed limit. We don't need this in a historic, residential and recreational neighborhood. Stop lights are only minimally able to reduce these hazards and maximally increase the noise and the pollution. Instead, the City should turn Midlothian Turnpike, Route 60,Â  from Westover Hills Blvd to Cowarding into the same size as it is west of that stretch and relieve Forest Hill Ave of unnecessary traffic. The city could put $ 12.000.000 into restoring the run down commercial area on Midlothian Turnpike, attract new businesses and make it attractive for the traffic to use the Turnpike.

Currently, there is a lot of traffic on Forest Hill, but widening the road would increase that dramatically.  With the wider lanes, more people would stop using the Downtown Expressway and cut through the neighborhood.  And it is a neighborhood! This would reduce the value of homes in the area and change its character.  It's already difficult to cross Forest Hill Ave, either walking or driving, and this would complicate it. There are many lovely homes on that part of Forest Hill. With smaller yards and a busier street, the values go down and the sense of neighborhood is lost. This is not necessary and strongly opposed by me and the Forest Hill neighborhood. For years, I've boasted about what a wonderful neighborhood this is.  Do not ruin it!!!   \n",
       "560      I strongly oppose this project. I have lived close to this proposed project for 30+ years.  Most of the day this two lane section is perfectly adequate for the amount of auto traffic. Rush hour traffic congestion on FH Avenue is caused primarily by commuters who could use the Downtown Expressway and Powhite Parkway to reach their destination, but prefer to travel on FH Avenue to avoid the tolls.  This project would encourage more rush hour traffic as well as speeding during other hours.  Increasing the roadway to four lanes would significantly degrade safe access for pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers from neighborhoods south of FH Avenue to Forest Hill Park, Good Shepherd Church and School and Forest Hill Presbyterian Church located on the northside of FH Avenue. Traffic calming, pedestrian and cycling safety improvements should be undertaken as well as investment in improved transit service not this project to increase vehicle capacity in this vibrant historic residential area!   \n",
       "563       As a resident of the Forest Hill neighborhood I am opposed to the widening of Forest Hill Ave from 47th to Semmes Ave as identified on the map.  Removal of trees from the urban forest will continue to reduce the many ecoservices trees provide including CO2 absorption and O2 production,  cooling of the urban landscape, soil health, and providing animal and plant habitat. In addition, the widening of the road will increase speed and traffic volume in this area impacting the biking and pedestrian community due to safety concerns. The historic character and designation of the neighborhood including Forest Hill Park will be adversely impacted by this project. Based on the widening of other sections of Forest Hill Ave, construction impacts to the neighborhood from the project  would last for several months or even years. I agree with others that the $12,000,000 estimated for the proposed project could be utilized for other city priorities including safety improvements and reforestation.   \n",

This is a historic road and need to stay as it is. There is no need for development and sprawl in the east end like has occurred in Short Pump. We need farms and open spaces.  Instead of developing the Varina area  take the run down areas and redevelop them.  Also as we look at climate control and pollution adding more asphalt and development in Varina will have more negative effects on the environment.   \n",
